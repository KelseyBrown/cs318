<h2><em>Bible Studies</em></h2>
    
<p>We believe that some of the greatest spiritual growth during your college years will happen in the context of community.  As you get around other people who are seeking God it will motivate you to learn and grow alongside them.  We offer some great ways for you to get connected with others in the Cru movement who want to deepen their relationships.</p>

<p>The best place to get connected is in a Bible study.  In contrast to the large number of people at our weekly meetings, a Bible study is a chance to get to know people better and learn about God with a small group of students.  Most groups meet for an hour a week to study a passage of scripture together, pray for each other, and just get to know about each other’s lives.</p>

<p>Bible studies are available in every dorm and for everyone on campus.</p>
