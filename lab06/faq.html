    <h3>I graduated last month and haven’t received my diploma yet. When will I get it?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
        Your diploma will be sent to you after grades have been recorded and other graduation requirements have been verified (4-8 weeks after commencement). The normal procedure is to mail it to the “diploma mailing address” which you have previously verified. If you would like to have it sent to a different address, please inform Degree Review.
